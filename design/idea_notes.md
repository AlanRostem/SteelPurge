# Pitched ideas

This text file notes down all the ideas for the game that may or may not make it into the final design. 

- Story and gameplay correlation: Using Chrono Drift is frowned upon in the story since it messes with time, which is why you get a lesser score when using it too much. 
- New enemy: Turret that locks on to the player and shoots a devastating blast
- Weapons are picked up instantly but can also be dropped
- Player has technically a high number of health, but can only take three hits from enemies. The high health pool exists so that healing with scrap will be gradual
- Story idea: The main character's recollection of memories transcends time and he has to solve puzzles in the area he recollected the memories to return to the present and alter the timeline for the better 
- Main Story Idea: People of the Earth had to leave for a new planet due to Earth's growing threat of global warming. Planet HS-921 was a good match for inhabiting but several of the important people that helped create technology were abandoned back on earth along with a large portion of the population. As a result, these people felt betrayed and decided to launch an advanced EMP attack on HS-921 that turned all their helper robots hostile. The main bosses are possesed by these abandoned people who died and transferred their souls to the robots.
- Auto lock-on Power-up: This allows the player to gradually aim at a target without having to perfectly line up their weapon with it
- Movement: the player can climb and bounce off walls
- The player must use Chrono Drift to set a checkpoint at a checkpoint station. These stations allow the player to use Scrap to heal and refill their ammo. 
- HM-4170 Mechanic: Scanning the same type of enemy several times allows you to get a perk against that type of enemy. I.e, a perk against the Rush Rogue allows you to shoot through their shield
- Enemies that wield hitscan weapons take time to lock on to the player (lock on is indicated) before shooting. The lock on can be disrupted by ram sliding into the enemy or performing other stun moves
- Make a projection of HM-4170 and the player stay at the location the Chrono Drift was activated
- HM-4170 is who activates the power-ups. Icon should be displayed on the HUD
- Three stats can be upgraded: Health, Rush Energy, Weapon Ammo. Upgrade points must be unlocked using Evo Cores and the points can be added to each stat to customize the stats. These stats can be customize before selecting a level
- Companion Drone Puzzle Idea: Similar to Crazy Diamon from JoJo, the drone can restore things back to the way it was using Chrono Drift. He can use this to restore destroyed objects or dismantle fully built ones
- Companion Drone Puzzle Idea: Rechargable battery - the drone can restore an empty battery's energy to full
- Companion Drone Puzzle Idea: When entering the puzzle area, the player is shown how all puzzle objects were affected. Based on that is how the objects can be turned back
- Companion Drone Puzzle Idea: Make the puzzles super simple, they do not need to be the main part of the game
