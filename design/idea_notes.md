# Pitched ideas

This text file notes down all the ideas for the game that may or may not make it into the final design. 

- Story and gameplay correlation: Using Chrono Drift is frowned upon in the story since it messes with time, which is why you get a lesser score when using it too much. 
- New enemy: Turret that locks on to the player and shoots a devastating blast
- Weapons are picked up instantly but can also be dropped
- Player has technically a high number of health, but can only take three hits from enemies. The high health pool exists so that healing with scrap will be gradual
- Story idea: The main character's recollection of memories transcends time and he has to solve puzzles in the area he recollected the memories to return to the present and alter the timeline for the better 
- Main Story Idea: People of the Earth had to leave for a new planet due to Earth's growing threat of global warming. Planet HS-921 was a good match for inhabiting but several of the important people that helped create technology were abandoned back on earth along with a large portion of the population. As a result, these people felt betrayed and decided to launch an advanced EMP attack on HS-921 that turned all their helper robots hostile. The main bosses are possesed by these abandoned people who died and transferred their souls to the robots.
- Auto lock-on Power-up: This allows the player to gradually aim at a target without having to perfectly line up their weapon with it
- Movement: the player can climb and bounce off walls
- Enemies that wield hitscan weapons take time to lock on to the player (lock on is indicated) before shooting. The lock on can be disrupted by ram sliding into the enemy or performing other stun moves
- HM-4170 is who activates the power-ups. Icon should be displayed on the HUD
- Focus on designing level elements that provide variety in combat the levels. For example, a platform that lifts in the air while enemies spawn in from the sides
