# Pitched ideas

This text file notes down all the ideas for the game that may or may not make it into the final design. 

- Story and gameplay correlation: Using Chrono Drift is frowned upon in the story since it messes with time, which is why you get a lesser score when using it too much. 
- Story element: The fast soldiers (and main character) are called Turbo Troopers
- New enemy: Turret that quickly locks on to the player and shoots a devastating blast
- Weapons are picked up instantly but can also be dropped
- Enemies harder to kill drop powerful weapons with abilities that enable secret speedrun spots
- Add power-up collectibles. Examples: Infinite Ammo, Insta Kill, Explosive Slide
- Player has technically a high number of health, but can only take three hits from enemies. The high health pool exists so that healing with scrap will be gradual
- Story idea: The main character's recollection of memories transcends time and he has to solve puzzles in the area he recollected the memories to return to the present and alter the timeline for the better 
- Main Story Idea: People of the Earth had to leave for a new planet due to Earth's growing threat of global warming. Planet HS-921 was a good match for inhabiting but several of the important people that helped create technology were abandoned back on earth along with a large portion of the population. As a result, these people felt betrayed and decided to launch an advanced EMP attack on HS-921 that turned all their helper robots hostile. The main bosses are possesed by these abandoned people who died and transferred their souls to the robots.
- Main story idea: The player character is a lone survivor of earths global warming disaster. He managed to create a ship that followed the main ship which transported lucky people to HS-921. The main character lost their memories after being cryo-frozen for so long in the one-man ship they used. The cryo freezing was required to survive long enough before the new people of HS-921 developed a habitable atmosphere. 
- When the player completes a puzzle or level, they can earn points to unlock perks. Perks are unique but are organized into categories. For now, the categories are Weapon Handling, Movement and Health
- Auto lock-on Weapon Handling perk: This perk allows the player to gradually aim at a target without having to perfectly line up their weapon with it
- Movement: the player can climb and bounce off walls
- The player must use Chrono Drift to set a checkpoint at a checkpoint station. These stations allow the player to use Scrap to heal and refill their ammo. 
- HM-4170 Mechanic: Scanning the same type of enemy several times allows you to get a perk against that type of enemy. I.e, a perk against the Rush Rogue allows you to shoot through their shield
- Enemies that wield hitscan weapons take time to lock on to the player (lock on is indicated) before shooting. The lock on can be disrupted by ram sliding into the enemy or performing other stun moves
- Make a projection of HM-4170 and the player stay at the location the Chrono Drift was activated
- Make Field Weapons purposefully be used for mini-puzzles and specific types of enemies by design so that the player has to strategically use the weapons and conserve ammo
- Make it so that the player can switch between all his weapons at any time. This might make Evo Cores completely useless and unlocking things will be done through scrap only, but this needs to be thought through
