\title{Steel Purge Game Design Document}

\begin{document}

\maketitle{}

\section{Overview}


\subsection{Concept}

Smooth high mobility platformer game with various types of power suits, levels, enemies and secrets. The game will feature multiple different objectives than the standard level completion of all platformers. 

\subsection{Genre(s)}

Run n' gun, platformer, sidescroller, action.

\subsection{Game Structure}

The game is a 2D sidescroller containing four levels per eight worlds where each level has a unique objective to complete per world. The objectives range from reaching the end of the level, collecting items and making sure you don't lose them, planting a bomb and last, but not least, defeating a boss.

% The game is a 2D sidescroller where the primary level type will start from left to right in the first half of the level objective like standard sidescrollers. The first half of the level is about carrying an explosive to a point. Along the way, there will be several obstacles and enemies posing a challenge to the player. After reaching the point, the player plant's the explosive and a timer starts. The player must now go back to the initial spawn point of the level within the bomb time limit. The level design will be two-way, meaning the first half will go from left to right and be more slow-paced as opposed to the second half which is more fast-paced. Since this is the primary level type, there will be more ways to play the levels, but this is the main selling point. 

\subsection{Look and Feel}

The game will be structurally similar to Super Mario Bros. on the NES and have 8bit style pixel art and music/audio with a mix of high-fidelity sounds. 

\section{Gameplay}

\subsection{Objectives}

\subsubsection{Purge the Steel}

This objective is the simplest of all. All the player must do is to exit the level in one piece. The level design will focus on aggressive combat play and will contain lots of secrets, but this does not need to be a strict rule. 

\subsubsection{Plant the Storm Bomb}

At the start of the level, the player is given an explosive item called the "Storm Bomb". The player must plant the item at the end of the level to complete half of the objective. After the player completes the "Plant the Storm Bomb", a timer for the bomb is set and the player must escape the level before the timer runs out. Escaping the level is done by going back to where the player started the level. If the timer runs out, the level explodes and the player dies. The level design will be created in such a way where it would be easy to learn going back and forth.

\subsubsection{Collect the Storm Cores}

The player must explore around the level to find Storm Cores, a collectible item, to progress towards completing the level. After collecting all Storm Cores, the exit will be unlocked and the player can complete the level by passing through the exit. If the player takes damage while having collected a Storm Core, they will drop it and must pick it up again. If the item falls into a pit or gets destroyed by a hazard, the item will spawn back at its original location and it will be indicated on the HUD. When holding one or more Storm Cores, taking damage will not drop your Turbo Suit Core. The level design will be very open, similar to metroidvania levels, and have the exit in an easily accessible location to make it more rewarding. 

\subsubsection{Defeat the Boss}

This type of level is the last level for the given world and the boss is located at the end of the level. All the player has to do is deal damage to the boss while dodging its attacks until the boss' health is depleted. This type of level will have the same design as the "Purge the Steel"-levels with an extra checkpoint and a boss-fight at the end. 

\subsection{Progression Systems}

\subsubsection{Scrap Score}

Scrap Score is a bragging-rights metric displayed at the title screen of the level showing how much scrap the player has collected in total after completing every level. 

\subsection{Play Flow}

Explain how the gameplay elements are connected to each other. Does it feel natural?

\subsection{Secrets Structure}

Every level has one or two secret areas that are not so obvious to find. Each secret will require a unique Turbo Suit Blaster to complete. The secret areas will have a puzzle-like structure in the obstacles which require the specific Turbo Suit Blaster as well.

\subsubsection{Rewards}

Secrets can reward the player with two different things: a supply crate and a passage to skip some levels. The supply crates contain a large number of Normal and Healing Scrap. Secondly, the secrets can also have a Perk Station present in its area. Lastly, the secret passage leading to the next level world is an alternative to end the level that rewards the player with a new path to the next world inside the level-selection screen. This last part is ideal for speedrunning. 

\section{Game Mechanics}

\subsection{Rules}

\subsubsection{Taking Damage}

Taking damage depletes one dot of health and knocks the player backwards and sending them into a temporary invincibility state. Additionally, the player drops their Turbo Suit Core on the ground when taking damage. Then, the player is only given a small amount of time to pick up the core again before it automatically disappears. 

\subsubsection{Health and Death}

The player has a limited amount of health which, once depleted, kills the player and they must start over from their last checkpoint. Dying causes the player to lose scrap (this affects the temporary amount the player has in the level). The health pool is comprised of three dots. Taking any form for damage depletes one dot. Below the health bar, there is a bar that will fill up when collecting Health Scrap. Once the bar is full, the player will be given one dot of health. The bar cannot fill up when the player has full health, and enemies won't drop health scrap. Instead, the player will be given extra normal scrap. 

\subsubsection{Rush Energy}

Rush Energy is a resource that allows the player to Power Slide and Recoil Boost. The player has a maximum of six dots of energy displayed on their HUD and each dot refills slowly only when the player is grounded. Different Turbo Suit Blasters will use different amounts of dots per shot when recoil boosting, and power-sliding uses one.

\subsubsection{Perk Lifetime}

The player can gain perks from Perk Stations secretly placed around a level in exchange for some scrap. After the player completes the level they found the perk from, the perk disappears and the player must find another Perk Station in the next level if they choose. 

\subsubsection{Scrap}

There are various types of scrap that enemies drop and they each have a different purpose. All types are dropped by enemies (some more/less than others) and are colored differently based on their use. All types of scrap spawn when an enemy is eliminated. Each is designed to reward the player for being aggressive, but also recover when they must play more carefully. 

\subsubsection{Scrap Loss upon Death}

The player will permanently lose some scrap each time they die.

\subsubsection{Normal Scrap}

The first type of scrap is the "economical" scrap (just called Scrap), which is colored as a standard rusty cogwheel. This type of scrap's amount is shown in the HUD and the player can carry as much as they want of it (there should be a very high maximum due to technical reasons). This scrap can be used to refill health  and ammunition at checkpoints. % but can also be converted to Evo Cores when the player completes a level. For every hundred scrap, the player earns an Evo Core at the end of the level.
The only way to gain this type of scrap is by damaging an enemy, which makes weaker Blasters useful for farming scrap. All scrap is lost when a level is completed and is converted to score. 

\subsubsection{Health Scrap}

Health Scrap is a green-colored cogwheel collectible that heals the player when collected. This type of scrap can only spawn when an enemy has below half of their health. After that, the health scrap can spawn when the enemy takes damage from the player. The companion drone starts using this scrap to repair the player's suit. 

\subsection{Interactions}

\subsubsection{Enemy vs. Player Contact}

If the player comes in contact with an enemy, the player will take a certain amount of damage

\subsubsection{Player Sliding into Enemies}

The player can slide into enemies to deal a small amount of damage and launch them up into the air. This is meant to let the player do one of two things: perform a "finishing move" to kill the enemy when the enemy's health is low, or to create crowd control. Additionally, this helps speedrunners. 

\subsection{Physics}

The game contains standard 2D kinematic non-realistic physics. Refer to the different game mechanics to know the specifics.

\subsection{Economy}

Not strictly about currency, but about resource-management. For example, cooldowns on abilities or remaining items in inventory. 

\subsubsection{Scrap}

Scrap is a gameplay currency used to refill health at checkpoints or used to purchase a perk at a Perk Station. When the player completes a level, they will lose all the scrap they collected and it will be converted to score. 

\subsection{Movement}

The player can move left and right just like any other 2D platformer. The walking is initially gradual but quick and seamless making it feel natural and easy to use. Jumping is also included in the character movement and the jump height is controllable.

\subsubsection{Crouch and Sliding}

The player can crouch by pressing a button, making him slower, able to crawl under tight spaces and is harder to detect by enemies. When the player moves at full running speed on the ground, presses the crouch button and has enough Rush Energy, the player will slide on the ground with boosted momentum. The player cannot change movement direction when sliding on the ground, but can reduce the speed by attempting to change directions. The player can also slide as soon as they hit the ground, but the speed must be equal to or lower than the default running speed, otherwise the player will just continue to slip on the ground. Sliding can be used to keep as much momentum as possible when moving extremely fast since the player will experience less ground friction. 

\subsubsection{Power Slide}

Power Slide is a faster version of the standard slide that allows the player to ram into enemies to deal damage and knock them in the air. This is the default setting for sliding but require Rush Energy to activate. If the player has enough Rush Energy, they can Power Slide. Otherwise, sliding is only possible when the player already has momentum higher than the default running speed. 

\subsubsection{Recoil Boosting}

Firing a Blaster while aiming downwards mid-air produces recoil that propels the player upwards so the player can stay in the air longer. Recoil Boosting depletes the Rush Energy meter. Every Blaster propels a different amount and uses varying values of Rush Energy. 

\subsection{Collectible Objects}

\subsubsection{Scrap Collectible}

\subsubsection{Turbo Suit Core Collectible}

\subsection{Key Objects}

Key objects are objects that can trigger a special effect using a specific Blaster's shots. They are meant to be used in combat and platforming.

\subsubsection{Incendiary Barrel Hazard}

The incendiary barrel is an explosive barrel that can be detonated by shooting at it using the Magma Suit or Rocket Suit Blasters. Enemies caught in the blast will be damaged, knocked away and have a burn-effect applied to them. If the player is caught in this blast, they will take one dot of damage and be knocked away with high momentum without being burned. It can also explode if it happens to collide with the tip of a Magma Spike. Explosions from other Incendiary Barrels can also trigger another Incendiary Barrel, but the Kinetic Suit's explosive projectiles can only push around the Incendiary Barrel, not detonate it. The explosions from Incendiary Barrels can also destroy breakable objects in the same way the Kinetic Suit's projectiles explosions can. These interactions exist so that the player can have many opportunities for completing mini-puzzles and take advantage of the Incendiary Barrel's properties during combat. 

\paragraph{Combat Purposes}

The player can use Power-Slide to re-position the barrel quickly to deal massive damage to an enemy elevated higher. The primary usage for this object is to explode it using a flame-based Blasters to clear out many enemies nearby or weaken strong enemies such as mini-bosses. This can also give the player momentum to escape combat at a cost for health. The player just needs to jump above the barrel, aim down and shoot at it with their flame-based Blaster to use the explosion to launch themselves far away from combat. This is risky, but can help the player complete the level faster. 

\paragraph{Secret Purposes}

The Incendiary Barrel's properties open up for a lot of opportunities in creating puzzle structures. The main thing the Incendiary Barrel provides is that it lets the player access a secret area behind a breakable obstacle by exploding it. 

\subsubsection{Magma Spike Hazard}

The Magma Spike is a breakable object that can be destroyed using explosions. If an enemy or the player hits it, they instantly die. 

\paragraph{Combat Purposes}

There is not much talk about when it comes to combat. It can help the player escape when destroyed and using utilities that push enemies towards it can also be helpful since it instantly kills them. The Kinetic Core is a perfectly balanced example of this, since the player can use that Blaster to knock enemies into the spikes, but also risk destroying it in the process, making it a strategic decision.

\paragraph{Secret Purposes}

The Magma Spike hazard prevents the player from reaching an area since it instantly kills him, making it easy for the level designer to hide secret areas since it is not apparent to the player that they can access what's behind the spikes. Accessing what's behind the spikes is only possible using explosions, which the Kinetic Core Blaster easily provides, but it's also slightly possible using flame-based Blasters too. 

\subsubsection{Metallic Surface}

\subsection{Objective Objects}

\subsubsection{Storm Bomb}

\subsection{Environmental Objects}

\subsubsection{Crate}

Crates are breakable objects that grant a reward for the player. Crates can contain different types of scrap. Some rarer crates also contain a Turbo Suit Core, but the type of core itself is not revealed until the crate is broken. The containments will be indicated by an icon on the crate. Power-slide, shooting or any other damaging ability can crack open a crate and drop its items. Power-sliding into a crate causes the contents to fly up into the air. 

\subsubsection{Damaged Obstacle}

Damaged obstacles are destructible and grant scrap upon taking damage and when destroyed, similar to how enemies work. They are used to add a fun way to progress the level and reward some scrap. These are square-shaped and blocky, which is meant to be distinguishable. These can be damaged using any Blaster. Explosive damage instantly destroys it. 

\subsubsection{Hardened Obstacle}

Similar to Damaged Obstacles, these can be destroyed to reveal secrets. However, these are only breakable through explosive damage (use the Kinetic Suit). 

\subsection{Other Objects}

\subsubsection{Perk Station}

A Perk Station is an object that the player can interact with to gain a passive ability in exchange for some scrap. 

\subsubsection{Checkpoint Station}

A Checkpoint Station defines the player's checkpoint once the player comes in contact with it. The player can also heal up in exchange for scrap. 

\subsection{Enemy Mechanics}

This section focuses on the enemies and their varying mechanics described in a similar fashion to the Objects section. 

\subsubsection{Melee Hitbox}

All enemies have a default hitbox that damages the player with one bar of health when the player touches the hitbox. 

\subsubsection{Damage Reception Hitbox}

This hitbox is the default area of the enemy that the player must deal damage to using Blasters or abilities. The hitbox spans the entire body of the enemy.

\subsubsection{Critical Damage Reception Hitbox}

This hitbox is similar to the default damage reception hitbox, only that it applies more damage to the enemy than normal. Additionally, this hitbox rests on top of the enemy's head and can only be hit if the player is above the enemy and aiming downwards at its head. Critical hit multipliers will varying amongst each enemy and some may die in one hit or more. 

\subsubsection{Types of Enemies}

\paragraph{Normal Enemy}

Normal Enemies are the minions that the player can kill without hitting too many shots. These are the most common and frequent enemy type the player will encounter. 

\paragraph{Enchanted Enemy}

Enchanted enemies are normal enemies with a higher health pool and have a Turbo Suit Core based power-up. They also drop a Turbo Suit Core when defeated. 

\paragraph{Mini Boss}

\paragraph{Boss}
\subsection{Enemy List}

Here is a list of all the enemies and their different mechanics. 

\subsubsection{Enemies (For Each)}

\paragraph{Moves}

\paragraph{Durability}

\paragraph{Mobility}

\paragraph{AI}

\paragraph{Difficulty}

\paragraph{Encounters}

\subsubsection{MXD-Hornet}

\paragraph{Moves}

The only move this enemy has is rushing towards the player.

\paragraph{Durability}

This enemy is is not very durable and critical hits from Blasters are a one-hit kill.

\paragraph{Mobility}

This enemy is very fast and can often catch the player off-guard. 

\paragraph{AI}

The MXD-Hornet is a spider-like enemy that moves very fast on the ground. At first, it patrols from left to right and when the player is near it, the enemy will briefly stop and start to rush towards the player. If it hits the player, the enemy explodes and does damage to the player. If the player jumped over the enemy during the rush, the enemy will stop for a moment do it again. 

\paragraph{Difficulty}

This enemy is meant to be very easy to defeat especially with the core mechanics of Recoil-Boosting

\paragraph{Encounters}

This enemy is very common and can be seen often throughout the first levels.

\subsubsection{Armoured MXD-Hornet}

This enemy is the exact same as the regular MXD-Hornet, but it can only take critical hit damage. The Firewall .127 upgrade and explosions are the only ways to directly damage this enemy. 

\subsubsection{Miner Exo}

\paragraph{Moves}

The only move this enemy has is striking the player with its pickaxe.

\paragraph{Durability}

This enemy is slightly more durable than the MXD-Hornet for reference and requires a few more critical hits to kill. 

\paragraph{Mobility}

The enemy can only walk normally towards the player, and is much slower than the MXD-Hornet for reference.

\paragraph{AI}

The enemy's default behaviour is to walk back and forth until the player is within a certain distance. Once the player is close enough, the enemy will start to charge at the player with its pickaxe and attempt to strike the player.

\paragraph{Difficulty}

This enemy is meant to be very easy to defeat especially with the core mechanics of shooting and evading attacks. 

\paragraph{Encounters}

This enemy is very common and can be seen often throughout the first levels.

\subsubsection{Ranged Miner Exo}

Ranged Miner Exo is the same as the regular Miner Exo, but the AI is a bit different. It will try to keep distance instead of charging towards the player and throws two pickaxes each time it attacks instead of meleeing. 

\subsection{Combat}

The combat mechanics in this game are very simple. The player can Power Slide, jump and fire their weapon. Secondly, firing a weapon causes the player to move slower on the ground, thus making it impossible to slide while firing on the ground. It is still possible to fire mid air or while sliding, making it possible for the player to keep their momentum. Weapons cal also be aimed up, down or diagonally and, with the use of a button, the player can lock themselves in place and aim in any direction without accidentally moving. Lastly, enemies have a weak spot on top of their head. The player must jump over the enemy and aim down to be able to hit it. Most enemies die from one hit on this weak spot and some take a few more hits. Power-sliding knocks enemies up in the air and leaves them vulnerable to the player's shots from below since some enemies cannot react to the knock-up.
These are the core combat mechanics, the rest is determined by the weapon the player has equipped.

\subsubsection{Turbo Suits Cores}

Turbo Suits Cores are modifications to the player's main suit that gives them a different blaster on their other hand. The blaster fires a different type of projectile with a special after-effect upon damaging an enemy. Additionally, the player gains a special passive ability that helps them through traversing a level. The player carries the Turbo Suit they picked up to the next level.

\paragraph{Neo Core}

Equips the player with a rapid-fire magnetic Blaster. Hitting an enemy enough times magnetizes the enemy and makes all your shots follow the enemy. This suit allows the player to walk on metallic surfaces.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Damage: 2
	\item Recoil-boost usage: ??
	\item Power-up: Walk on metallic surfaces
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Kinetic Core}

Equips the player with an explosive energy orb Blaster. The orbs can propel any object on impact, including the player. The propelling property of the orbs is meant to allow the player to rocket-jump and gain massive momentum at a cost for Healing Scrap since it also damages the player. The explosion from the orbs can also destroy stone-based hazards and damaged obstacles. This suit surrounds the player with a kinetic energy shield that allows the player to take one hit without losing health and walk on hazards for a short period. The shield recharges after a few seconds when it is used.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Direct-hit Damage: 5
	\item Explosive Damage: 5
	\item Recoil-boost usage: ??
	\item Power-up: Shield that protects against one hit
	\item Shield-recharge time: ??
\end{itemize} 


\paragraph{Magma Core}

Equips the player with a blaster that shoots a spread flare pellets that burn enemies over time. This is the only Blaster that can trigger explosive barrels, which do high damage to enemies and allows the player to rocket-jump on them. This weapon can also burn down flammable objects and allows the player to swim in magma.  

\begin{itemize}
	\item Damage per Pellet: 2
	\item Pellet count per shot: 5
	\item Burn-damage per second: 2
	\item Recoil-boost usage: ??
\end{itemize} 

\paragraph{Rocket Core}

Equips the player with a rocket blaster shooting small micro-missiles that can detonate explosive objects. This suit allows the player to slide faster and deal more Power-Slide damage. If the player runs out of Rush Energy, they can still Power Slide with the default speed and damage.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Damage: 5
	\item Recoil-boost usage: ??
	\item Power-up: Increased slide length and damage
\end{itemize} 

\paragraph{Null Core}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Damage: 
	\item Recoil-boost usage:
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Standard Suit}

The player always is equipped with a short-ranged Blaster that deals a small amount of damage.

\paragraph{Turbo Suit} 

Default suit with a minimal damage Blaster that fires rapidly. The damage is hit-scan based. It lets the player Recoil-boost in the air without falling.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Shot type: Limited range hit-scan
	\item Damage: 1
	\item Recoil-boost usage: ??
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Perks}

The player can acquire perks through Perk Stations found in secret areas on a level. There are several unique perks in the game and they disappear when the player exits the level they found the perk in. Getting perks costs scrap, making it harder to gain, but this is intentional since perks are meant to be very powerful. 

\subsubsection{Storm Rounds}

Amplifies the damage output of the currently equipped Blaster by 20\% and increases the rate of fire. This adds an ammo pool to the Blaster, making this ability disappear when the player runs out of it. Taking damage will not make the player drop their Turbo Suit Core. The player will not lose this perk when switching out their Turbo Suit for another, but the ammo is scaled accordingly.

\subsubsection{Storm Energy}

The player will never run out of Rush Energy when Power Sliding or Recoil Boosting. Additionally, Power Sliding into enemies will shock them and deal immense damage. However, using this technique consumes Rush Energy and can only be used three times since Rush Energy does not recharge at this state. 

\subsubsection{Storm Armour}

The player is equipped with three additional temporary health. When taking damage from an enemy, the enemy is instantly defeated and other enemies in the area are damaged and shocked.

\section{Story}

\subsection{Back Story}

The back story will be told throughout the main story of the game. 

\subsubsection{A New Home}

It is year 3036 and the Earth is reaching its inevitable demise from the global warming. Scientists across the globe banded together to locate a habitable planet to transfer the human race to a new home. Planet HS-921 was a great candidate for a new home since it was several times larger than Earth and distanced perfectly from its sun to host life on its surface. In this time period, the human race was  developed enough to travel across solar systems, but not everyone could join the journey. Only rich people, scientists and military personnel were privileged to live on HS-921. The global warming apocalypse had deprived resources for building enough spaceships for the whole population, but the scientists promised to use HS-921's resource-rich ground for building an opportunity for the people back home to travel as well. Sadly, several decades passed by as the earthlings were being consumed by the apocalypse. The inhabitants of HS-921 never came back to help the earthlings, but it was never their intention to begin with. This promise was only used as propaganda to let rich people and scientists escape for a better life and leave Earth to rot alone. 

\subsubsection{The Exo}

In this time of Earth's abandonment, the people of HS-921 thrived upon Dr. Hamilton's Fabricator. The mysterious and exceptional scientist developed a machine that extracts metallic minerals from HS-921's core while simultaneously building and programming helper robots that did all the manual labour required to build a home. These robots were called the Exo, a highly modular and intelligent manual labour robot serving the creation and maintenance of a new planetary home. The Fabricator generated more Exos than the human population on HS-921. This meant both a good and a bad thing...

\subsubsection{The Shock}

Several more decades passed with the Exos' helping the people on HS-921 build a home, until a sudden electric blast hit the atmosphere. This shock briefly disabled all computer technology, including the Exos. A few days pass by without any technological activity, making it difficult for people to develop the new home, let alone survive in it. After a crippled development, the Exos started to activate again, but they turned hostile towards the people on HS-921. Everyone was attacked and imprisoned while many Exos were taking over every important facility and Fabricator. The people were hopeless to prevail, since not even the military personnel had functional weapons after The Shock. 

\subsubsection{A Spark of Hope}

Dr. Hamilton, despite the technological cripples, managed to develop a replacement for computer-based technology. Planet HS-921 happened to generate a strange and mythical power through its storms. Hamilton  discovered a crystal that can call in the mythical storms. These crystals are called Storm Shards and were used to create Storm Cores: a device that manipulates The Storm's energy. This energy was be used to develop computer technology that was not susceptible to the same Shock the Exos and other standard computer technology was. New and more powerful military weapons were deployed and communication systems could never be compromised ever again. There was hope for survival, but The Storm had a limit... Utilizing a high amount of Storm Energy per Storm Core would deplete the Storm Shards material stability, rendering it useless. Thus, a group of highly skilled soldiers were trained to utilize The Storm's power to fight back against the Exos in an efficient manner. These highly formidable soldiers were known as the Turbo Troopers. They were trained to be fast, agile and smart with their resources at hand. They were equipped with weaponry that could shoot as long as they do not use too much energy and suits that increased their movement speed, protected them from heavy damage and made them physically stronger. 

\subsubsection{The Great Metal War}

It was the Turbo Troopers against the Exos. A war broke out between a limited amount of highly skilled soldiers and dangerous self-developing robots. For every battle won by the Turbo Troopers, they collected the scrap metals from the defeated Exos for later use. Sadly, the Exos outnumbered the Turbo Troopers and more died as the Exos produced more of themselves using the hacked Fabricators. There were less and less Turbo Troopers as days went on. Dr. Hamilton's efforts were exceptional and delivered hope, but one man cannot stand against an infinite army of lethal robots. A few Turbo recruits were left alive since they were never sent out to battle, and luckily, there was still hope of finding the last professional Turbo Trooper...

\subsubsection{The Last Trooper}

In the early days of The Great Metal War, Dr. Hamilton secretly instructed a specific Turbo Trooper to deliver Storm Shards to Earth to save the people with a new technology. Despite the lies told to the earthlings, Hamilton was one of the only scientists that wanted to save Earth, he just needed time to figure out a solution and deliver it. Sadly, this Turbo Trooper couldn't complete the mission... Flying in his spaceship, right before reaching the first layer of HS-921's atmosphere, The Storm struck the Trooper's spaceship and caused it to crash-land through a mountain and into a mining facility inside it. Strangely, the ship was covered in Storm Energy and protected it from the crash damage, but the Trooper piloting it suffered a concussion and was laying unconscious for several days. During this time, the war was still ongoing. The Turbo Trooper was laying unconscious until the Exos won and the people of HS-921 lived in constant oppression...

\subsubsection{HM-4170's mission}

Dr. Hamilton realized that there is barely any hope of training Turbo Troopers. He developed a survey drone with the power to travel time, but this time power had some limits. This drone could only travel time to observe a location's past, but in the event that the drone succeeded the mission, the Trooper would be granted to use this power in dire needs. HM-4170, the survey drone, went to scout for the Turbo Trooper. The drone analysed as many locations as possible and managed to locate the crash site. The Turbo Trooper was found laying in an electrified ship and completely unconscious. HM-4170 depleted the Storm Energy surrounding the crashed ship and revived the Trooper. After reviving him, the drone introduced itself, but it appeared that the Trooper had lost all his memories from the concussion. HM-4170 instructed the Turbo Trooper to ready his weapon and get out of the mining facility before being consumed by the Exos ahead. The game begins...

\subsection{Cut Scenes}

Descriptions about the actors included, the setting and a set of scripts.

\section{Game World}

\subsection{Look and Feel}

The game world is in a sci-fi-style planet with life similar to nature on Earth but with alien-like quirks. The game will feature a level selection screen from a top-down world inside a home base where the player selects where to land. The game is structured from a level-selection screen where the player chooses which level to play on. Each level is a sidescroller 2D level similar to Super Mario games. 

\subsection{Areas (For Each)}

\subsubsection{Description and Physical Characteristics}

\subsubsection{Relations to the Rest of the World}

\subsection{Mining Facility FB-12}

This area is where the first level will be a part of, but as soon as the player completes this level, other areas will be used for the further levels. This area is still possible to come back to for extra content. 

\subsubsection{Description and Physical Characteristics}

This area is a usual mining facility inside a large mountain cave, but with lost of advanced metallic sci-fi mineshafts and storage rooms. The background of the levels will feature stalagmites and gemstones with some metallic structures holding things in place. Some areas will have piles of stones and ores to signify that the place is under work by the Exos. Some places will also have Exos mining ores with pickaxes. There will also be some incendiary barrels that contain gunpowder which can be exploded using the Magma Blaster. 

\subsubsection{Relations to the Rest of the World}

This mining facility is one of many facilities used by the people of HS-921 to gather resources. The Exos being created from the Fabricator located here are programmed to adapt to the harsh conditions of mines and learn efficient ways to mine resources. Just like every other Exo, these were hacked to attack any human in sight and will use all their tools at their disposal to attack the main character. This is where the main character crash-landed and was found by HM-4170.

\section{Characters}

\subsubsection{Personality}

\subsubsection{Appearance}

\subsubsection{Abilities}

\subsubsection{Relevance to the Story}

\subsubsection{Relationships}

\subsection{HM-4170}

\subsubsection{Back Story}

HM-4170 is a Chrono-Drifted Survey Drone. It was created to find the last surviving Turbo Trooper after The Great Metal War. HM-4170's protocol is to never interact with any object while back in time and to only scan it to gather information.

\subsubsection{Personality}

% \subsubsection{Combat Areas with Mini-Objectives}

% Combat areas with mini-objectives are separate areas on the levels where certain enemies appear to guard the player against an objective. The types of enemies and amount of each type are placed in a certain way to have synergy so that the combat does not feel shallow and too simple. These combat areas are not meant to be the primary way to encounter and fight enemies since enemies will appear almost anywhere depending on a given level's design. 

% \subsubsection{General Areas (Mixed with platforming and combat and secrets)}

% WIP: This subsection describes the general areas the player will encounter as a continuous pace of the level. Since this game is a sidescrolling platformer, there will obviously be platforming on the levels. This includes simple parkour by jumping and using other movement mechanics and avoiding hazards. From the section describing all the game objects, some objects will be used to help the player either in combat or to complete mini-puzzles to unlock secrets. Some objects can be interacted with only by shooting at it using a specific weapon and the rest have their own specific quirks. The objects will be based on the level's theme, which is commonly tied to a field weapon (also ones that are meant to be unlocked on the level itself). Generally, there will always be a small amount of enemies and environmental hazards for the player to encounter and overcome as part of the level challenges. Using the objects that can only be interacted with using Field Weapons, the player can access secret areas and get rewards. The objects will be placed in a non-obvious manner. 

% \subsubsection{Secret Areas and Rewards}

% Secret areas can be reached through plaforming or using a weapon's unique trait to access a key object to help with the platforming. Secret areas can reward the player with weapon ammo, scrap or sometimes the ability to skip many levels. 

% Secret areas can be reached through puzzles using the companion drone, regular exploration, platforming and using Key Objects. Secrets can reward the player with a High-Tier Power-Up or a Weapon Upgrade.

% \subsubsection{Checkpoint Placement, Usage and Purpose}

% Despite the fact that the player can make a checkpoint wherever they want using Chrono Drift, there will be "automatic" checkpoints placed throughout the level with extra functionality. These checkpoints are where the player will respawn if they die, hence why it was referred to as an automatic checkpoint. The player just needs to collide with the checkpoint to mark it as a respawn-point. Additionally, this type of checkpoint allows the player to use scrap to instantly refill ammo and heal up to full health. The checkpoints are made to get the player up-to-speed on the challenges that are to come and make it more intuitive to retry after death. They are normally placed so that they are available after several combat areas and before objectives, puzzles and platforming areas. However, this can vary depending on a given level's design. Levels will only have one checkpoint to make the game simple, but the exception is levels with boss fights that always have a checkpoint near them (which makes the level have two checkpoints). 

% \subsubsection{Objective Placement and Types}

% \paragraph{Planting Bomb at Objective}

% This objective type will be most common for the levels. At the very end of a level, there is a large Fabricator that the player must plant an explosive at (simply by pressing a button). This starts a timer before the explosive detonates so that the player has room to escape the level before the detonation. At the objective point, there will be enemies guarding it. Depending on the level's design and difficulty, there will be either regular enemies (small minions) or mini-bosses guarding it, so the player must defeat them before proceeding. Escaping the level successfully (returning to the start of the level) within the timer means completing the level. 

% \paragraph{Boss Fights}

% Some levels have a boss at the very end which the player must defeat in order to complete the level. Each boss design will be unique and have a relevance to the story.

\section{Interface}

\subsection{Visual System}

The interface will be a simple pixel-art based interface with menus and a HUD. Progress bars will be avoided as much as possible for conveying gameplay elements since it is too difficult to do in a pixel art style. 

\subsubsection{HUD}

The in-game heads-up display will only show necessary information about the player's status initially. This includes health and scrap. Lastly, the Rush Energy meter is also a part of the HUD.

\begin{itemize}
	\item TODO: Show images of all the HUD behavior
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Gameplay Dialogues}

Characters that speak to the player through the story will have their dialogues conveyed through text boxes that pop up on the player's HUD. The companion drone will often talk to the player, so that is why dialogue boxes will often appear while the player is playing in a level. Dialogue boxes appear at the top of the screen with an image of the character next to its name. The text continuously writes itself in a slow manner, but the player can press and hold the interact button to make it go quicker. After the text is complete, the player can press the interact button to move to the next line. The button bound to skipping lines will also show up next to the dialogue. Dialogue boxes can also be disabled in the settings menu. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item TODO: Show images of all the dialogue behavior
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Companion Drone Speech Bubbles}

The companion drone will sometimes assist the player using hints to remind them of the objective. This is conveyed through speech bubbles above the player (since the drone is rested on top of the player's head). Hints are short and are usually used to remind the player about the mechanics in the beginning. However, further down the game, these will be used for dramatic effect through the story.

\subsubsection{Menus}

\subsubsection{Camera Model}

\subsection{Control System}

This section focuses on the varying controls the player has available and the scope of them. 

\subsubsection{In-Game Input}

The input options when the player is playing in a level will be limited to the buttons on a classic SNES controller. That does not mean other controllers are not compatible, but that the button layout is limited for the simplicity of the game. Even a keyboard and mouse will be usable, the point is that there won't be the need for more buttons than that of a SNES controller.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Audio}

The audio will include a mix of 8-bit sounds and a very small amount of semi-realistic sounds. The same will apply to the music, where real instruments and 8-bit music is mixed together, but 8-bit will still dominate. This is to make it easier to implement audio/music, since it breaks the limitation of 8-bit and adds a little charm to the musical art. 

\subsection{Art}

The game's art will be pixel-art with a light-hearted science fiction look using the limited color palette of the NTSC Nintendo Entertainment System console. The levels will be structured by pixel-art 16x16 tiles and most character sprites will have 32x32 resolution. There will be several different environments, but the general look of the environment will have an alien-like nature mixed with sci-fi buildings.
