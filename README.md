# Steel Purge

Steel Purge is a passion project I'm working on for both learning Godot Engine and fun.
All ideas are my own, but the game mechanics are heavily inspired by the Call of Duty: 
Zombies series.

## Ideas

### Background Story

It is the year 2034 and the world is undergoing a global industrial revolution. This time,
military technology is the hope of every land's survival. Countries are putting
resources, including their people, into weapon production in order to dominate any war 
that inevitably arises. You are working for district Goliath-A1, the primary weapons 
factory of your government that spans two thirds of the capital. Every employee must wear 
a specialized industrial body armor which protects from any accidental friendly fire at 
the workplace. This factory only produces ballistic infantry weapons, but your curiosity
doesn't fool you. Seeking around the deeper structures of the factory, you find a hatch
which seemingly would lead to a sewer. Being your curious you, you open the hatch and for
some reason strong chiming winds throw you into the hole which leads to a strangely large
sewer. It is dark, but some lights work. Through the dark alleys of the sewer, strange
metalized humanoid beings emerge with malicious intent. An industrial revolver that came 
along with the winds rests on the ground. Your options become clearer by the second. 

### Game Goal

Neutralize *Experimental Warbots* (a.k.a X-Warbs) using ballistic weapons to progress to 
as many waves as possible. Waves increase when all 20 X-Warbs have been destroyed for a 
given wave. The higher the wave, the harder the X-Warbs are to kill (they get increased
hit-points). The X-Warbs drop *Scrap* when eliminated, which can be used to forge weapons
on *Ballistations* (machines that weld weapons from scrap). 

### Progression system



#### Black Hat Keys

*Black Hat Keys* are a currency that the player can keep outside of the gameplay. They are used to unlock 
*Ballistations*. At the spawn location for the player, there is a *Workbench* where the player can craft 
*Black Hat Keys* and "deposit" them (essentially saves the amount of *Black Hat Keys*). 

#### Scrap

*Scrap* is a gameplay progression unit that is essentially the currency of the game. *Scrap* can be used
to make weapons and ammo and also upgrade the weapons. All *Scrap* is deleted when losing or quitting a game.  

### Movement

The movement in Steel Purge will be quite simple but should have some twists.

#### Auto-sprint

After the player has walked for a few seconds without interruptions he starts sprinting.

#### Double-tap sprint 

Player must double tap a movement key to engage in sprinting mode

### Shooting

Player can shoot with his equipped weapon

#### Recoil-hovering

By firing downwards the player can fall slower. The slower the weapon makes you walk while firing the slower it makes you fall
