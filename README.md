# Steel Purge

Steel Purge is a passion project I'm working on for both learning Godot Engine and fun.
All ideas are my own, but the game mechanics are heavily inspired by the Call of Duty: 
Zombies series.

## Ideas

### Background

It is the year 2034 and the world is undergoing a global industrial revolution. This time,
military technology is the hope of every land's survival. Countries are putting
resources, including their people, into weapon production in order to dominate any war 
that inevitably arises. You are working for district Goliath-A1, the primary weapons 
factory of your government that spans two thirds of the capital. Every employee must wear 
a specialized industrial body armor which protects from any accidental friendly fire at 
the workplace. This factory only produces ballistic infantry weapons, but your curiosity
doesn't fool you. Seeking around the deeper structures of the factory, you find a hatch
which seemingly would lead to a sewer. Being your curious you, you open the hatch and for
some reason strong chiming winds throw you into the hole which leads to a strangely large
sewer. It is dark, but some lights work. Through the dark alleys of the sewer, strange
metalized humanoid beings emerge with malicious intent. An industrial revolver that came 
along with the winds rests on the ground. Your options become clearer by the second. 

### Game Goal

Neutralize *Experimental Warbots* (A.k.a X-Warbs) using ballistic weapons to progress to 
as many waves as possible. Waves increase when all 20 X-Warbs have been destroyed for a 
given wave. The higher the wave, the harder the X-Warbs are to kill (they get increased
hit-points). The X-Warbs drop *Scrap* when eliminated,
