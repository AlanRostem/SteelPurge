# Steel Purge

Steel Purge is a passion project I'm working on for both learning Godot Engine and fun.
All ideas are my own, but the game mechanics are heavily inspired by the Call of Duty: 
Zombies series.

## Ideas

### Background Story

It is the year 2034 and the world is undergoing a global industrial revolution. This time,
military technology is the hope of every land's survival. Countries are putting
resources, including their people, into weapon production in order to dominate any war 
that inevitably arises. You are working for district Goliath-A1, the primary weapons 
factory of your government that spans two thirds of the capital. Every employee must wear 
a specialized industrial body armor which protects from any accidental friendly fire at 
the workplace. This factory only produces ballistic infantry weapons, but your curiosity
doesn't fool you. Seeking around the deeper structures of the factory, you find a hatch
which seemingly would lead to a sewer. Being your curious you, you open the hatch and for
some reason strong chiming winds throw you into the hole which leads to a strangely large
sewer. It is dark, but some lights work. Through the dark alleys of the sewer, strange
metalized humanoid beings emerge with malicious intent. An industrial revolver that came 
along with the winds rests on the ground. Your options become clearer by the second. 

### Game Goal

Survive by making the weapons you can to make it out of the apocalypse you found yourself in. 
The game is a pretty simple platformer with level completion and the strive for the progression
system. 

### Progression system

The progression system in Steel Purge will feature RPG style features as well as simple platformer
traits like completing levels.

#### Gunsmith levels

The player can gain experience and level up. Leveling up to a certain point gives the player the ability
to craft new weapons, essentially "learning" how to make the new ones.

#### Weapon Blueprints

Weapon blueprints can be found in order to unlock the ability to craft certain weapons. 

#### Weapon Drops

Weapons can be dropped by enemies, even ones the player does not know how to craft. Weapons can be researched
but will be destroyed in exchange for a blueprint.

#### Black Hat Keys

*Black Hat Keys* are a currency that the player can keep outside of the gameplay. This idea is yet to be used
somewhere. 

#### Scrap

*Scrap* is a progression unit that is essentially the currency of the game. *Scrap* can be used
to make weapons and ammo and also upgrade the weapons. 

### Movement

The movement in Steel Purge will be quite simple but should have some twists.

#### Auto-sprint

After the player has walked for a few seconds without interruptions he starts sprinting.

#### Double-tap sprint 

Player must double tap a movement key to engage in sprinting mode

### Weapons

Weapons in Steel Purge are guns that use up ammo and need to be reloaded. They can also be upgraded 
to 4 different stages that affect their stats and add additional features to them

#### Weapon Stages

#### Shooting

Player can shoot with his equipped weapon in 4 different directions. 

#### Recoil-hovering

By firing downwards the player can fall slower. The slower the weapon makes you walk while firing the slower it makes you fall
