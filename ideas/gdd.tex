\section{Overview}


\subsection{Concept}

Smooth high mobility platformer game with various types of guns, levels, enemies and puzzles. The game will feature multiple different objectives than the standard level completion of all platformers. 

\subsection{Genre(s)}

Run n' gun, platformer, sidescroller, action, RPG.

\subsection{Game Structure}

The game is a 2D sidescroller where the primary level type will start from right to left in the first half of the level objective unlike standard sidescrollers. The first half of the level is about carrying an explosive to a point. Along the way, there will be several obstacles and enemies posing a challenge to the player. After reaching the point, the player plant's the explosive and a timer starts. The player must now go back to the initial spawn point of the level within the bomb time limit. The level design will be two-way, meaning the first half will go from right to left and be more slow-paced as opposed to the second half which is more fast-paced. Since this is the primary level type, there will be more ways to play the levels, but this is the main selling point. 

\subsection{Look and Feel}

Summarize the visuals and the basic style of the game. Use similar products as example. 

\section{Gameplay}

\subsection{Objectives}

\subsubsection{Plant the Storm Fuse}

At the start of the level, the player is given an explosive item called the "Storm Fuse". This is where the game starts from the  opposite side of the map, a.k.a from right to left as opposed to the natural sidescroller starting point. The player must plant the Storm Fuse to complete a part of the level. 

\subsubsection{Evacuate from the Explosion}

After the player completes the "Plant the Storm Fuse", a timer for the bomb is set and the player must escape the level before the timer runs out. If the timer runs out, the level explodes and the player dies. Completing this objective means completing the level. 

\subsubsection{Purge Mode}

Purge Mode is an event the player can play on any level after finishing three (amount is arbitrary) levels in a row. In the lore, a level is invaded by a swarm of enemies and they can be optionally cleared out. The level will remain invaded until the player either chooses to play the Purge Mode event or choose to call a Storm Strike to clear the enemies out (this costs expensive Scrap). In this mode, the level will just serve as an arena for a wave-based survival mode where enemies constantly spawn for each wave. Completing a wave drops an orb floating in the air the player can choose to pick up or leave for ten seconds before the player automatically leaves the level. Picking it up starts another wave with stronger and more varied enemies. Once the player is finished with the waves or dies, they will be awarded with Cipher Cores corresponding to the amount of waves they cleared.

\paragraph{Purpose}

This mode is good for farming scrap since enemies drop it, but it will also be useful for getting Cipher Cores since mini-bosses drop it. Additionally, the player can unlock new weapons if they reach high waves since undiscovered enemies may appear.

\subsection{Progression Systems}

\subsubsection{Data Core}

Cipher Cores are the essential collectible item to unlock new things in the game. These are obtainable by killing bosses, mini-bosses, completing levels with max rank and completing puzzles. 

\subsubsection{Unlocking Blocked-off Levels}

Blocked-off levels can be accessed using a specified number of Cipher Cores. These levels are slightly harder to complete than the pre-set difficulty of the "world" the level is a part of, but grant the ability to skip most of the levels once completed. This can help speedrunning, but make it more challenging. 

\subsubsection{Power-Ups}

Power-ups are unlockable by Cipher Cores 

\subsubsection{Weapon Unlocks for Deployment}

Completing a level while having a newly discovered weapon in your inventory gives you the opportunity to unlock that weapon and have the ability to call in a supply drop with that weapon in it. When back at the home base, the player can use a set amount of Cipher Cores to "research" the weapon and unlock it so that the player can deploy it any time. 

\subsection{Play Flow}

Explain how the gameplay elements are connected to each other. Does it feel natural?

\subsection{Side-Challenge Structure}

The side-challenges exist to motivate the player to complete the level fully to achieve a higher rank, which is displayed on level completion. At the end of a level, the player is given information on their performance for each side-challenge. Completing a side-challenge will grant the player at least one Cipher Core, but completing all of them per level will give two extra (the numbers aren't important here, just that the amount is higher than normal). 

\subsubsection{Kill All Enemies}

Most levels have a finite number of enemies. Killing all enemies on a level is a side-challenge.

\subsubsection{Break your Evacuation Record}

There is a pre-defined time trial record that the player can break as part of the evacuation process of a level. If the player has already broken this record and has completed all side-challenges for a specific level before, the player can theoretically gain infinite amounts of Evo Cores by constantly breaking the record. This 

\subsubsection{Take No Damage}

Taking no damage during the playing of a level is a side-challenge. 

\subsubsection{Chrono-Drift Usage}

Using Chorno Drift reduces the player's progress to the max rank.

\subsection{Puzzle Structure}

Every level has one or two puzzles that are not so obvious to find. Each puzzle will require a unique weapon ability, or two, to complete. This puzzle structure's presence is similar to that of The Breath of The Wild. 

\section{Game Mechanics}

This is a critical part of the design document. Emphasize this section when writing.

\subsection{Rules}

\subsubsection{Health}

The player has a limited amount of health which, once depleted, kills the player. The health is divided into three segments. This means the player has, let's say, 120 health, but each segment is worth 40 health. When an enemy does damage to the player, they do 40 damage to deplete one segment of health. This exists so that the player can gradually heal when picking up scrap while maintaining a simple health structure. 

\subsubsection{Scrap Loss on Death}

When the player dies, they lose a certain number of scrap so that losing is discouraged.

\subsubsection{Rush Energy}

Rush Energy is a resource meter that allows the player to Power Slide, Recoil Boost and perform other Movement Perk abilities. Rush Energy gradually recharges when not used. 

\subsection{Interactions}

\subsubsection{Enemy vs. Player Contact}

If the player comes in contact with an enemy, the player will take a certain amount of damage

\subsubsection{Player Sliding into Enemies}

The player can slide into enemies to deal a small amount of damage and launch them up into the air. This is meant to let the player do one of two things: perform a "finishing move" to kill the enemy when the enemy's health is low, or to create crowd control. Additionally, this helps speedrunners complete ANY\% speedruns. 

\subsection{Physics}

The game contains standard 2D kinematic non-realistic physics. Refer to the different game mechanics to know the specifics.

\subsection{Economy}

Not strictly about currency, but about resource-management. For example, cooldowns on abilities or remaining items in inventory. 

\subsubsection{Scrap}

Scrap is a currency used call in supply drops that contain field- and standard weapons. Picking up scrap also heals you, but you store half  less scrap as you normally would when you have been damaged. 

\subsubsection{Field-Weapon Ammo and Cooldowns}

Field weapons have limited ammunition and some field weapon abilities are put on a cooldown when used. 

\subsection{Movement}

The player can move left and right just like any other 2D platformer. The walking is initially gradual but quick and seamless making it feel natural and easy to use. Jumping is also included in the character movement and the jump height is controllable.

\subsubsection{Slip Jump}

If the player jumps as soon as they change directions, the player receives a boost in momentum towards the new direction.

\subsubsection{Crouch and Sliding}

The player can crouch by pressing a button, making him slower, able to crawl under tight spaces and is harder to detect by enemies. When the player moves at full running speed on the ground, presses the crouch button and has enough Rush Energy, the player will slide on the ground with boosted momentum. The player cannot change movement direction when sliding on the ground, but can reduce the speed by attempting to change directions. The player can also slide as soon as they hit the ground, but the speed must be equal to or lower than the default running speed, otherwise the player will just continue to slip on the ground. Sliding can be used to keep as much momentum as possible when moving extremely fast since the player will experience less ground friction. 

\subsubsection{Power Slide}

Power Slide is a faster version of the standard slide that allows the player to ram into enemies to deal damage and knock them in the air. This is the default setting for sliding but require Rush Energy to activate. If the player has enough Rush Energy, they can Power Slide. Otherwise, sliding is only possible when the player already has momentum higher than the default running speed. 

\subsubsection{Recoil Boosting}

Firing a weapon while aiming downwards mid-air produces recoil that propels the player upwards so the player can stay in the air longer. Recoil Boosting depletes the Rush Energy meter. Every weapon propels a different amount and uses varying values of Rush Energy.

\subsubsection{Metallic Surface}

\subsubsection{Storm Fuse}

\subsubsection{Null Transporter}

\subsection{Enemy Mechanics}

This section focuses on the enemies and their varying mechanics described in a similar fashion to the Objects section. 

\subsubsection{Melee Hitbox}

All enemies have a default hitbox that damages the player with one bar of health when the player touches the hitbox. 

\subsubsection{Damage Reception Hitbox}

This hitbox is the default area of the enemy that the player must deal damage to using weapons or abilities. The hitbox spans the entire body of the enemy.

\subsubsection{Critical Damage Reception Hitbox}

This hitbox is similar to the default damage reception hitbox, only that it applies more damage to the enemy than normal. Additionally, this hitbox rests on top of the enemy's head and can only be hit if the player is above the enemy and aiming downwards at its head. Critical hit multipliers will varying amongst each enemy and some may die in one hit or more.

\subsection{Combat}

The combat mechanics in this game are very simple. The player can Power Slide, fire their weapon and use the weapon's ability. Lastly, enemies have a weak spot on top of their head. The player must jump over the enemy and aim down to be able to hit it. Most enemies die from one hit on this weak spot and some take a few more hits. When the player runs out of ammo in their Field Weapon, they have the option to throw it at an enemy to deal massive damage. This does consume Rush Energy.
These are the core combat mechanics, the rest is determined by the weapon the player has equipped.

\subsubsection{Field Weapons}

Field weapons are weapons that can only be unlocked by bringing it back to the home base after level completion and cost some Evo Cores. Field weapons have a limited ammo capacity and a special after-effect or perk along with it.

\paragraph{M7 Neostar}

Rapid-fire magnetic machine-gun. A quick charge up time is required for the weapon to fire, but it can be spammed to keep it at almost-max charge. Hitting an enemy enough times magnetizes the enemy and makes all your shots follow the enemy. It is also possible to magnetize metallic surfaces in the same way.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ammo capacity: 200
	\item Damage: 2
	\item Recoil-boost usage: ??
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{KE-60}

Explosive energy orb launcher that can propel any object, including the player. The propelling property of the orbs is meant to allow the player to rocket-jump and gain massive momentum at a cost for HP since it also damages the player. The explosion from the orbs can also destroy stone-based hazards and obstacles. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ammo capacity: 30
	\item Direct-hit Damage: 5
	\item Explosive Damage: 5
	\item Recoil-boost usage: ??
\end{itemize} 


\paragraph{Firewall .127}

Flame shotgun that burns enemies over time. The weapon fires a spread of flame pellets for each shot. This is also the only weapon that can trigger explosive barrels, which do high damage to enemies and allows the player to rocket-jump on them. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ammo capacity: 50
	\item Damage per Pellet: 2
	\item Pellet count per shot: 5
	\item Burn-damage per second: 2
	\item Recoil-boost usage: ??
\end{itemize} 

\paragraph{Falcon SLR}

Rifle with a rocket and bayonet attached. It shoots projectile bullets propelled by the rocket receiver of the weapon. Wielding this weapon allows the player to slide faster and deal more melee-based damage (i.e., Power Slide). If the player runs out of Rush Energy, they can still Power Slide with the default speed and damage. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ammo capacity: 50
	\item Damage: 5
	\item Recoil-boost usage: ??
\end{itemize} 


\paragraph{Nullshatter IDSR}

Reality-shattering inter-dimensional sniper rifle. Fires slowly and makes infinitely long cracks in space-time to deal damage to anything that comes in contact with it. This weapon generally instantly kills enemies. Shooting at Null Transporters activates a portal that you can use to briefly enter the Null Dimension and avoid all damage. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ammo capacity: 
	\item Damage: 
	\item Recoil-boost usage:
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Stormhammer}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ammo capacity: 
	\item Damage: 
	\item Recoil-boost usage:
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Standard Weapons}

Standard weapons are weaker than Field Weapons and are not equipped with a special ability. However, to balance this, these weapons can be unlocked using Scrap instead of Evo Cores and have infinite ammo.  These exist so that the player has a weapon to start with or have on at all when the player runs out of ammo on his Field Weapons. The reason standard weapons have infinite ammo is because they are powered by The Storm and shoot white Storm Lasers. 

\paragraph{Hamilton M99} 

Default pistol with infinite ammunition that fires rapidly. The damage is hit-scan based. It lets the player Recoil-boost in the air without falling.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ammo capacity: infinite
	\item Damage: 1
	\item Recoil-boost usage: ??
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Bikomek M-SAR} 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ammo capacity: infinite
	\item Damage: 3
	\item Recoil-boost usage: ??
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Back Story}

HM-4170 is a Chrono-Drifted Survey Drone. Survey Drones were manufactured to scout desolate areas of Planet HS-921 to find possible supplies, but HM-4170 was modified to travel back in time to analyse a location's past for information. HM-4170's protocol is to never interact with any object while back in time and to only scan it to gather information. HM was sent on a mission to trace the last known Turbo Trooper after The Great Metal War. 

\subsubsection{Personality}

Inspired by similar robot characters such as BT-7274 from Titanfall 2. HM-4170 is innocent and obedient with a problem-solving and supportive initiative. He does not have the best social skills and lacks the ability to understand sarcasm and irony, but is always willing to learn.
