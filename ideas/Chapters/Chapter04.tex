\section{Player Traits}

This section describes all the traits the player has regarding movement among other things.

\subsection{Hearts / Hit Points}


\subsection{Health regeneration and invincibility}

When the player is hit by an enemy, they are invulnerable for a short time. This will be displayed as a protective bubble around the player. This design's purpose is to tell the player that they can avoid damage for some time and use it to their speed-running advantage. Killing certain enemies can recharge your health, and this should be made apparent through the game art. 

\subsection{Movement}

The player movement in Steel Purge is a standard platformer movement with walking and jumping. Due to the limited input the player will have, there are some twists on how he can move.

\subsubsection{Gravity and Left-Right Movement + Jumping}

The player character in Steel Purge falls and can walk from left to right and jump on top of obstacles.

\subsubsection{Recoil-Hovering}

By firing downwards the player can fall slower after each fire interval. The player has a limited amount of shots 

\subsubsection{Sliding}

The player can slide on the ground and on slopes. Sliding allows the player to build up momentum and jump in order to keep that momentum. Combining this with \emph{recoil hovering} lets the player keep the high momentum for longer. Sliding into enemies also deals damage to them and knocks them up into the air.
