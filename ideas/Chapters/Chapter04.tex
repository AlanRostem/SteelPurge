\section{Player Traits}

This section describes all the traits the player has regarding movement among other things.

\subsection{Hearts / Hit Points}

The player can be hit by enemies or hazards up to three times before dying. In the lore, the player's suit can activate a protective shield every time they are hit. But, if they are hit all three times, it means the shield had no more energy left and thus the player died to the devastating damage. 


\subsection{Health regeneration and invincibility}

When the player is hit by an enemy, they are invulnerable for a short time. This will be displayed as a protective bubble around the player. This design's purpose is to tell the player that they can avoid damage for some time and use it to their speed-running advantage. Killing certain enemies can recharge your health, and this should be made apparent through the game art. 

\subsection{Movement}

The player movement in Steel Purge is a standard platformer movement with walking and jumping. Due to the limited input the player will have, there are some twists on how he can move.

\subsubsection{Gravity and Left-Right Movement + Jumping}

The player character in Steel Purge falls and can walk from left to right and jump on top of obstacles.

\subsubsection{Recoil-Hovering}

By firing downwards the player can fall slower after each fire interval. The player has a limited amount of shots 

\subsubsection{Sliding}

The player can slide on the ground and on slopes. Sliding allows the player to build up momentum and jump in order to keep that momentum. Combining this with \emph{recoil hovering} lets the player keep the high momentum for longer. Sliding into enemies also deals damage to them and knocks them up into the air. 

\subsubsection{Ram-Sliding}

Sliding into enemies with high enough momentum can knock enemies into the air and deal damage to them.
