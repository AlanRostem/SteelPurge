\section{Movement}

The player movement in Steel Purge is a standard platformer movement with walking and jumping. Due to the limited input the player will have, there are some twists on how he can move.

\subsection{Gravity and Left-Right Movement + Jumping}

The player character in Steel Purge falls and can walk from left to right and jump on top of obstacles.

\subsection{Recoil-Hovering}

By firing downwards the player can fall slower. The slower the weapon makes you walk while firing the slower it makes you fall
