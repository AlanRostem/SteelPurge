\section{Enemies}

To make a challenge and a reason for the player to use their weapons, there are unique enemies placed in certain area on each level providing a challenge to the player. In this section, there will be a description of each enemy in the game.

\subsubsection{Minions}

\paragraph{XW Front Rogue}

Melee based enemy that can climb surfaces and follows the player

\paragraph{XG Rush Rogue}

Rushes the player to attack. If the player jumps over the enemy while it was rushing, it stops in its tracks acting confused. This confusion will allow the player to aim downwards and attack the enemy's critical hit point.

\paragraph{AR-43 Executioner}

Robot that looks like a Terminator from the movie. It shoots bursts of projectiles horizontally towards the player in intervals. Between every interval, the enemy starts closing the distance between the player. Henceforth, the enemy can also melee. 

\subsubsection{Mini-bosses}

\paragraph{â€¢}

\subsubsection{Bosses}

\paragraph{HG Titan of Law}

Large robot that slams the ground to attack the player. Each slam, if the player is on the ground, causes the player to fly upwards when the boss misses the player. The knees of this boss are critical hit points. When the boss is destroyed, their legs collapse and it falls over being destroyed even more.
