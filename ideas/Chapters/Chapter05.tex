\section{Story}

% It is the year 2034 and the world is undergoing a global industrial revolution. This time, military technology is the hope of every land's survival. Countries are putting resources, including their people, into weapon production in order to dominate any war that inevitably arises. You are working for district Goliath-A1, the primary weapons factory of your government that spans two thirds of the capital. Every employee must wear a specialized industrial body armor which protects from any accidental friendly fire at the workplace. This factory only produces ballistic infantry weapons, but your curiosity doesn't fool you. Seeking around the deeper structures of the factory, you find a hatch which seemingly would lead to a sewer. Being your curious you, you open the hatch and for some reason strong chiming winds throw you into the hole which leads to a strangely large sewer. It is dark, but some lights work. Through the dark alleys of the sewer, strange metalized humanoid beings emerge with malicious intent. An industrial revolver that came along with the winds rests on the ground. Your options become clearer by the second.

For one hundred years humans managed to thrive across solar systems with their new found technology. Every stone planet became habitable using extractors that transferred energy inside planetary cores to artificial atmospheres. The humans race was never to face extinction and could be seen to dominate the cosmos. Nevertheless, the homo sapien species alone did not have the strength, nor durability, to achieve the greater heights of cosmic habitation. A majority of their man power consisted of a robotic humanoid technology, known as <robot name here>.
