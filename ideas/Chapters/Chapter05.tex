\section{Story}

% It is the year 2034 and the world is undergoing a global industrial revolution. This time, military technology is the hope of every land's survival. Countries are putting resources, including their people, into weapon production in order to dominate any war that inevitably arises. You are working for district Goliath-A1, the primary weapons factory of your government that spans two thirds of the capital. Every employee must wear a specialized industrial body armor which protects from any accidental friendly fire at the workplace. This factory only produces ballistic infantry weapons, but your curiosity doesn't fool you. Seeking around the deeper structures of the factory, you find a hatch which seemingly would lead to a sewer. Being your curious you, you open the hatch and for some reason strong chiming winds throw you into the hole which leads to a strangely large sewer. It is dark, but some lights work. Through the dark alleys of the sewer, strange metalized humanoid beings emerge with malicious intent. An industrial revolver that came along with the winds rests on the ground. Your options become clearer by the second.

\subsection{The world's backstory}

Planet HS-921 became the first habitable exo-planet in human history. This was a gigantic step for mankind! Shipping people and supplies to a planet light years away from the home base was not an easy task, though. Luckily, the humans were prepared with a fascinating piece of technology that accelerated their development! The mysterious, yet wonderful scientist, Dr. Hamilton created the "Fabricator": a giant machine that extracts metals from any planet's core and builds any technology on the spot! Hamilton programmed this machine to create helpful robots that carry the various heavy workloads required to build a home on HS-921. The Fabricator constantly crafted robots that gathered building materials, farmed foods and enforced laws on the home base. These helpful robots, called X-Warbs, were key to building a giant ship to safely transport people to HS-921 and build a home there.
