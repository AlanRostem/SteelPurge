\subsection{The world's backstory}

Planet HS-921 became the first habitable exo-planet in human history. This was a gigantic step for mankind! Shipping people and supplies to a planet light years away from the Home Base was not an easy task, though. Luckily, the humans were prepared with a fascinating piece of technology that accelerated their development! The mysterious, yet wonderful scientist, Dr. Hamilton created the "Fabricator": a giant machine that extracts metals from any planet's core and builds any technology on the spot! Hamilton programmed this machine to create helpful robots that carry the various heavy workloads required to build a home on HS-921. The Fabricator constantly crafted robots that gathered building materials, farmed foods and enforced laws on the Home Base. These helpful robots, called X-Warbs, were key to building a giant ship to safely transport people to HS-921 and build a home there. Eventually, the humans were successful in building the new home. However, there were several consequences to living on HS-921. Among other things, communications to the Home Base was nearly impossible, which meant that emergencies were more dangerous to the people of the new home. After some decades on HS-921, a strange electromagnetic burst hit the atmosphere and shut off all computer-based technology, including the ever helpful X-Warbs.
