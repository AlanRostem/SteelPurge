\section{Story}

% It is the year 2034 and the world is undergoing a global industrial revolution. This time, military technology is the hope of every land's survival. Countries are putting resources, including their people, into weapon production in order to dominate any war that inevitably arises. You are working for district Goliath-A1, the primary weapons factory of your government that spans two thirds of the capital. Every employee must wear a specialized industrial body armor which protects from any accidental friendly fire at the workplace. This factory only produces ballistic infantry weapons, but your curiosity doesn't fool you. Seeking around the deeper structures of the factory, you find a hatch which seemingly would lead to a sewer. Being your curious you, you open the hatch and for some reason strong chiming winds throw you into the hole which leads to a strangely large sewer. It is dark, but some lights work. Through the dark alleys of the sewer, strange metalized humanoid beings emerge with malicious intent. An industrial revolver that came along with the winds rests on the ground. Your options become clearer by the second.

\subsection{The world's backstory}

For one hundred years humans managed to thrive across solar systems with their new found technology. Every stone planet became habitable using extractors that transferred energy inside planetary cores to artificial atmospheres. The human race was to never face extinction and could be seen to dominate the cosmos. Nevertheless, the homo sapiens alone did not have the physical strength, nor durability, to achieve the greater heights of cosmic habitation. The majority of their forces consisted of a robotic humanoid technology, known as the Auxilite. Varying shapes and sizes of these obedient robots fit almost every need one could imagine. With the help from all the Auxilites, planet HS-921, or "Portus", became the central habitable planet for all the humans. Mass production of various technologies and desirable living conditions rested at Haven with a shining bright future. However, there is a reason this harmony lasted for only a century. On one Portusian day, a strange and sudden impulse hit the planet freezing all computer-based technology. The freeze lasted for several days and put the people of Portus' lives at risk. New measures had to be developed to help survive independently from the robotic helpers until a solution to this mysterious demise. Several decades passed without assistance from the Auxilites and human kind was forced to open a new technological path that was more simplified and comprehensible to anyone of this generation.
