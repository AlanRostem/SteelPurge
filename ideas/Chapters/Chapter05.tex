\section{Story}

% It is the year 2034 and the world is undergoing a global industrial revolution. This time, military technology is the hope of every land's survival. Countries are putting resources, including their people, into weapon production in order to dominate any war that inevitably arises. You are working for district Goliath-A1, the primary weapons factory of your government that spans two thirds of the capital. Every employee must wear a specialized industrial body armor which protects from any accidental friendly fire at the workplace. This factory only produces ballistic infantry weapons, but your curiosity doesn't fool you. Seeking around the deeper structures of the factory, you find a hatch which seemingly would lead to a sewer. Being your curious you, you open the hatch and for some reason strong chiming winds throw you into the hole which leads to a strangely large sewer. It is dark, but some lights work. Through the dark alleys of the sewer, strange metalized humanoid beings emerge with malicious intent. An industrial revolver that came along with the winds rests on the ground. Your options become clearer by the second.

\subsection{The world's backstory}

For one hundred years humans managed to thrive across solar systems with their new found technology. Every stone planet became habitable using extractors that transferred energy inside planetary cores to artificial atmospheres. The human race was to never face extinction and could be seen to dominate the cosmos. Nevertheless, the homo sapiens alone did not have the physical strength, nor durability, to achieve the greater heights of cosmic habitation. The majority of their forces consisted of a robotic humanoid technology, known as the Auxillite. Varying shapes and sizes of these obedient robots fit almost every need one could imagine. With the help from all the Auxillites, planet HS-921, or "Portus", became the central habitable planet for all the humans. Mass production of various technologies and desirable living conditions rested at Portus with a shining bright future. 

\paragraph{}
However, there is a reason this harmony lasted for only a century. On one Portusian day, a strange and sudden impulse hit the planet freezing all computer-based technology, including all the Auxillites. The freeze lasted for several days and put the people of Portus' lives at risk. New measures had to be developed to help survive independently from the robotic helpers until a solution to this mysterious demise came to be. Several decades passed without assistance from the Auxillites and human kind was forced to open a new technological path that was more simplified and comprehensible to anyone of this generation. Everyone survived, but the living standards were fleeting.

\paragraph{}
The Auxillites on Portus were even more abundant than the human population. This fact posed a threat for the Portusian people, as the robots started to suddenly function again, but without control. A strange vicious aura emitted from every Auxillite and no one was able to command the robots, nor even read their source code. They began capturing people from homes, workplaces and city centrals relentlessly. Anyone who opposed them were neutralized. Several military forces had to defend against the abundant attacks from the Auxillites. However, since the military technology was mostly computer-based, the evil aura emitted from the robots constantly disabled the weapons, rendering anyone defenceless. 

\paragraph{}
The people of Portus were no longer thriving, but hope was never lost. A lonesome and mysterious inventor by the name of Dr. Hamilton discovered that the thunderstorms on planet Portus could generate a special type of energy. Referred to as "Tempest Currents", it is a resource able to disrupt and manipulate electronics to anyone's will, yet is also a gateway to a more advance technology. Hamilton's work became Portus' greatest hope for prevail, as the scientist enabled hundreds of revolutionary technologies made to counter the Hostile Auxillites. Computer technology was based on this new energy and could never be hacked or interfered with. The people of Portus saw hope, but not with peace...

\paragraph{}
Military forces needed to change with the technology simultaneously and this was not an easy feat.
