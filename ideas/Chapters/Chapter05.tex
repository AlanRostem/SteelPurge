\section{Story}

% It is the year 2034 and the world is undergoing a global industrial revolution. This time, military technology is the hope of every land's survival. Countries are putting resources, including their people, into weapon production in order to dominate any war that inevitably arises. You are working for district Goliath-A1, the primary weapons factory of your government that spans two thirds of the capital. Every employee must wear a specialized industrial body armor which protects from any accidental friendly fire at the workplace. This factory only produces ballistic infantry weapons, but your curiosity doesn't fool you. Seeking around the deeper structures of the factory, you find a hatch which seemingly would lead to a sewer.

Your options become clearer by the second.

Every stone planet became habitable using extractors that transferred energy inside planetary cores to artificial atmospheres. The human race was to never face extinction and could be seen to dominate the cosmos. Nevertheless, the homo sapiens alone did not have the physical strength, nor durability, to achieve the greater heights of cosmic habitation. The majority of their forces consisted of a robotic humanoid technology, known as <robot name here>. Varying shapes and sizes of these obedient robots fit almost every need one could imagine. With the help from all the <robot name here>s, planet HS-921, or "Haven", became the central habitable planet for all the humans. Mass production of various technologies and desirable living conditions rested at Haven with a shining bright future. However, there is a reason this harmony lasted for only a century. On the Day of Adversity, a strange and sudden impulse hit planet Haven freezing all computer-based technology. The freeze lasted for several days and put the people of Haven's lives at risk. New technology had to be developed to help survive in the harsh conditions and
