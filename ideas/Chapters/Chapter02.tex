\section{Weapons}

Every weapon is a pair of gauntlets that can shoot projectiles and used for melee. The weapons in Steel Purge will be the primary source of attacking enemies. Weapons have infinite ammo. The weapons also have some extra specialities spoken about in this chapter. The player should be able to carry one weapon at a time, but can switch to a different one when entering a menu.

\subsection{Weapons are unique}

Every weapon should signify a special trait or element that only a particular weapon can posses.

\subsection{Weapon ordinance}

Weapons, in addition to firing, have a special ability called an \emph{ordinance}. It uses a specific resource in order to be utilized. This ability is usually a form for utility, mobility or lethality.

\subsection{All Weapon Ideas}

This section consists of all the ideas for each weapon.

\paragraph{Joule}

Kinetic energy orb launchers. Projectiles create an explosion on impact that deals damage and knocks enemies away. 

Ordinance: Kinetic Bubble - Create a constant wave of kinetic energy around yourself that blocks any incoming damage

\paragraph{Firewall}

Flame-thrower-shotgun gloves. Fires projectile flares that, upon consecutive hits, burns enemies.

Ordinance: Dragon's Breath - Activate a strong stream of fire that burns enemies and can act as a jet-pack when firing downwards.

\paragraph{Falcon}

Rocket-powered ballistic knife launcher. Fires four rocket-knives at a time that come back to the player when the knives are far enough away. They deal damage to any enemies it hits when on its way back.

Ordinance: Rocket Charge - Activate the rocket system and charge towards an enemy to stab them with immense damage. Hitting an enemy stops the rockets. 

\paragraph{Neostar}

Electro-magnetic energy manipulator. Fires a constant volley of metal debris around the area using magnetic forces.

Ordinance: Vortex Slam - Jump into the air and slam the ground and cast a magnetic area that lifts up enemies and holds them in place. Firing your weapon guides your projectiles to the enemies held in place.
