\section{Weapons}

Every weapon is a pair of gauntlets that can shoot projectiles and used for melee. The weapons in Steel Purge will be the primary source of attacking enemies. Weapons have infinite ammo. The weapons also have some extra specialities spoken about in this chapter. The player should be able to carry one weapon at a time, but can switch to a different one when entering a menu.

\subsection{Weapons are unique}

Every weapon should signify a special trait or element that only a particular weapon can posses. This will affect what they shoot, what their entire kit is based on, a unique passive ability and a single special ability. 

\subsection{Weapon ordinance}

Weapons, in addition to firing, have a special ability called an \emph{ordinance}. It uses a specific resource in order to be utilized. This ability should usually allow for utility, mobility and lethality.

\subsection{Weapon mechanics}

Each weapon has a special mechanic to them that are used both for combat and level design. For instance, a flame weapon that can burn down ice barriers which hold access to secret areas. Most of the time, the unique mechanics of the weapon should be emphasized in a level in order to introduce its uniqueness. 

\subsection{All Weapon Ideas}

This section consists of all the ideas for each weapon.

\paragraph{Joule}

Kinetic energy orb launchers. Projectiles create an explosion on impact that deals damage and knocks enemies away. 

Ordinance: Kinetic Bubble - Create a constant wave of kinetic energy around yourself that blocks any incoming damage

Mechanic: Explosive orbs can break down certain obstacles and allows the player to propel themselves using the explosive impact (preferably using the ordinance in order to protect from the damage).

\paragraph{Firewall}

Flame-thrower-shotgun gloves. Fires projectile flares that, upon consecutive hits, burns enemies.

Ordinance: Dragon's Breath - Activate a strong stream of fire that burns enemies and can act as a jet-pack when firing downwards.

Mechanic: Can break down obstacles weak to fire

\paragraph{Falcon}

Rocket-powered ballistic knife launcher. Fires four rocket-knives at a time that come back to the player when the knives are far enough away. They deal damage to any enemies it hits when on its way back.

Ordinance: Rocket Charge - Activate the rocket system and charge towards an enemy to stab them with immense damage. Hitting an enemy stops the rockets. 

Mechanic: Allows the player to reach platforming areas they otherwise could not

\paragraph{Neostar}

Electro-magnetic energy manipulator. Fires a constant volley of metal debris around the area using magnetic forces.

Ordinance: Vortex Slam - Jump into the air and slam the ground to deal damage to enemies around and simultaneously cast a magnetic area that lifts up enemies and holds them in place. Firing your weapon guides your projectiles to the enemies held in place.

Mechanic: Allows the player to stick to metal surfaces, reaching spots they otherwise could not have. 

\paragraph{Worldline}

Dark matter generator that fires compressed dark osmium chunks in a slow upwards-arcing movement. When the projectile hits a surface or enemy, it creates a small black hole. Consecutive hits on a surface increases the power and size of the black hole dealing more damage to the enemies and sucks them in faster. 

Ordinance: ???

Mechanic: ???
