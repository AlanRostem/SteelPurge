\section{Weapons}

Every weapon is a pair of gauntlets that can shoot projectiles and used for melee. The weapons in Steel Purge will be the primary source of attacking enemies. Weapons have infinite ammo. The weapons also have some extra specialities spoken about in this chapter. The player should be able to carry one weapon at a time, but can switch to a different one when entering a menu.

\subsection{Weapons are unique}

Every weapon should signify a special trait or element that only a particular weapon can posses. This will affect what they shoot, what their entire kit is based on, a unique passive ability and a single special ability. 

\subsection{Weapon ordinance}

Weapons, in addition to firing, have a special ability called an \emph{ordinance}. It uses a specific resource in order to be utilized. This ability should usually allow for utility, mobility and lethality.

\subsection{Weapon mechanics}

Each weapon has a special mechanic to them that are used both for combat and level design. For instance, a flame weapon that can burn down ice barriers which hold access to secret areas. Most of the time, the unique mechanics of the weapon should be emphasized in a level in order to introduce its uniqueness. 

\subsection{All Weapon Ideas}

This section consists of all the ideas for each weapon.

\paragraph{H-58}

Standard issue arm cannons delivered by Hamilton Armory. Fires directed energy projectiles in a moderate fire rate. 

Ordinance: Laser Burst - Fire two powerful laser shots that knock enemies back and impales them. The lasers do collateral damage. 

\paragraph{Joule}

Shoots kinetic energy orbs. The orbs create an explosion on impact that deals damage and knocks enemies away. 

Ordinance: Kinetic Bubble - Create a constant wave of kinetic energy around yourself that blocks any incoming damage

Mechanic: Explosive orbs can break down certain obstacles and allows the player to propel themselves using the explosive impact (preferably using the ordinance in order to protect from the damage).

\paragraph{Firewall}

Flame-thrower-shotgun gloves. Fires projectile flares that, upon consecutive hits, burns enemies.

Ordinance: Dragon's Breath - Activate a strong stream of fire that burns enemies. It can also act as a jet-pack when firing downwards.

Mechanic: Can break down obstacles weak to fire

\paragraph{Falcon}

Launches sharp kinetic energy blasts through the wind in quad-bursts.

Ordinance: Aerial Charge - Manipulate the wind to charge through the air and strike enemies with great damage. Hitting obstacles in this state will stop the flight. 

Mechanic: Allows the player to reach platforming areas they otherwise could not

\paragraph{Neostar}

Ionic metal manipulator. Fires a constant volley of metallic debris extracted from ions in the air using magnetic forces. Multiple consecutive hits will magnetize the target causing all your projectiles to follow the target.

Ordinance: Vortex Slam - Jump into the air and slam the ground to unleash a blast scattering magnetized metal debris with large magnetic energy around it. Enemies caught in the blast will be lifted in the air and targeted by your weapon.

Mechanic: Firing at metal surfaces will magnetize it allowing you to walk on it and reach greater heights. 

\paragraph{Nullshatter}

Reality-shattering gauntlets that send two astral punches to a target at a time to deal damage. Consecutive hits on a target will slowly crack the barrier between reality and the Null-Dimension. If a target is killed, a small portal will open and suck nearby targets in to immobilize them.

Ordinance: Tunnel Punch - Punch through the barrier between reality and the Null Dimension to avoid all damage. A brief speed-boost is gained at the start of this ability and enemies can still be damaged, despite being in a different dimension. The map remains the same, but some indicated obstacles can disappear.

Mechanic: Melee kills can open a portal to the null dimension. 

\subsection{Enemy ideas}

\subsubsection{Minions}

\subsubsection{Bosses}

\paragraph{Death Hornet X-09}

Spider-like boss that moves on the ground in its first form. At 75\% health it will turn into its second form and start flying above the player. For its first form, it can melee the player and drop XW Rush-Rogue enemies on the player. It also has a critical hit-box on top of its head. When it reaches its second form, it will start flying left to right and drop XW Rush-Rogues from the air. The player can still shoot at the boss by aiming up, but the damage will be minimal. The key is to ram-slide into the Rogues in order to uppercut them into the boss to deal even more critical damage since they explode on the boss. Three Rogue hits is enough to kill it from this point, but when it is only one hit left to kill it, the boss will move faster.
