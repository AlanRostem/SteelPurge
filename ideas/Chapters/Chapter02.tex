\section{Weapons}

Weapons in Steel Purge are found around levels and they have a limited amount of ammo. The player will always spawn with the Hamilton P336 pistol which has infinite ammo, but can carry over the weapon from the previous level. If the player runs out of ammo on a specific weapon, they will throw it at an enemy to deal massive damage and switch back to the standard pistol. 

\subsection{Weapons are unique}

Each weapon fires automatically by holding down a button, but \emph{what} they shoot is always different and has a unique effect. 

\subsection{Weapon ability}

Weapons, in addition to firing, have a special ability. The ability is unique, but should at least allow for some mobility implicitly. Each ability will be put on a cool-down before the player can use it again, with the exception of the Hamilton P336. Additionally, this ability consumes extra ammo for the weapon.

\subsection{Recoil hovering}

By aiming downwards and shooting mid-air, the player can stay in the air longer by propelling themselves up using the recoil of the weapon. 

\subsection{All Weapon Ideas}

\paragraph{Hamilton P336} 

Default pistol with infinite ammunition that fires rapidly. The damage is hit-scan based. It has no special ability but lets the player recoil-hover in the air without falling.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ammo capacity: infinite
	\item Damage: 1
	\item Recoil-hover shots: 6
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{M7 Neostar}

Rapid-fire magnetic gatling-gun. A quick charge up time is required for the weapon to fire, but it can be spammed to keep it at almost-max charge. It's special ability is called "Death Vortex". The ability is a close-range beam-type attack that does minimal damage, but if it kills an enemy, it adds 50 ammo back to the weapon. This ability can also be used to propel yourself off magnetic metal surfaces. There are no other ways to get ammo for the weapon other than the ability.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ammo capacity: 200
	\item Damage: 2
	\item Recoil-hover shots: 6
	\item Ability ammo cost: 20
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{KE-60}

Explosive energy orb launcher that can propel any object, including the player. The propelling property of the orbs is meant to allow the player to rocket-jump and gain massive momentum at a cost for HP since it also damages the player. It's special ability is called "Kinetic Shield", which is a bubble of kinetic energy that protects the player against one hit, effectively giving it extra HP. This ability also meant to help the player rocket-jump.

It's ability is called "Dragon's Breath". The ability lasts forever but uses ammo over time and faster. It is a deadly stream of fire that deals massive damage to enemies and can also be used to recoil-hover more effectively.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ammo capacity: 50
	\item Damage per Pellet: 2
	\item Pellet count per shot: 5
	\item Burn-damage per second: 2

\paragraph{Hadron Railgun}

Triple burst laser rifle that instantly eliminates enemies if all lasers hit. It's ability is called "Quantum Path".
