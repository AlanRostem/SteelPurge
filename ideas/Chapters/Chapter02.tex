\section{Weapons}

The weapons in Steel Purge will be the primary source of attacking enemies. Weapons have ammo, but they are only limited to how often the player can shoot at a time before reloading. The weapons also have some extra specialities spoken about in this chapter. The player should be able to carry one weapon at a time, but can switch to a different one when entering a menu.

\subsection{Weapons are unique}

Every weapon should signify a special trait or element that only a particular weapon can posses.

\subsection{Weapon ordinance}

Weapons, in addition to firing, have a special ability called an \emph{ordinance}. It uses a resource called \emph{XE-Slugs} in order to be utilized and is usually a form for utility, mobility or lethality.

\subsection{Firing types}

There are several unique ways a weapon can fire projectiles that do damage. Each is meant to be used in different ways forcing the player to employ different play-styles. Each firing type is launched at the horizontal looking direction of the player. 

\subsubsection{Hit-scan direct}

A straight ray 

\subsubsection{Hit-scan spread}

Multiple straight rays spread out in a cone shape

\subsubsection{Homing projectile}

An entity that starts moving towards its target when close enough


\subsection{All Weapon Ideas}

This section consists of all the ideas for each weapon.

\paragraph{KE-6 Swarm}

Kinetic energy orb launcher. Projectiles are explosive and track enemies after a certain distance they travel. 

Ordinance: Kinetic Bubble - Fire a large slow projectile that can be stood on top of. It goes through the environment but pushes enemies into walls and crushes them. The more enemies crushed, the more damage the bubble takes and then disappears. Enemies can still attack through it.

\paragraph{Firewall .127}

Flame-thrower-shotgun hybrid. Fires projectile flares that, upon consecutive hits, burns enemies.

Ordinance: Dragon's Breath - Activate a strong stream of fire that burns enemies and can act as a jet-pack when firing downwards.

\paragraph{Falcon RR}

Lever-action rifle with direct hit-scan firing. It has a bayonet and a rocket attached to it.

Ordinance: Rocket Charge - Activate the weapon's rocket system and charge in the direction you are looking. Hitting an enemy while charging does massive damage to them. Doing this mid-air lets you fly.
