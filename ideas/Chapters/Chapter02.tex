\section{Weapons}

The weapons in Steel Purge will be the primary source of attacking enemies. Weapons have ammo, but they are only limited to how often the player can shoot at a time before reloading. The weapons also have some extra specialities spoken about in this chapter. The player should be able to carry two weapons and switch between them quickly.

\subsection{Enhancements from Weapon Parts}

As parts for weapons exist in the game, each weapon has three part slots compatible for every weapon no matter what it looks like or what it shoots.

\subsubsection{Barrel Mod}

The \emph{Barrel Mod} is an attachable enhancement for the weapon which grants it extra effects when the weapon is firing. I.e, the enhancement makes the weapon shoot burning bullets causing enemies to catch on fire after consecutive hits. 

\subsubsection{Ordinance Mod}

This enhancement is essentially an extra weapon attached to the weapon itself. I.e, a flame-thrower attachment. The input action bound to using this enhancement is separate from the primary firing action. In addition, the enhancement uses a different limited resource. Lastly, the \emph{Barrel Mod}'s effects are also applied to the \emph{Ordinance Mod}

\subsubsection{Tactical Mod}

Similar to the \emph{Ordinance Mod}, it is an external attachment on the weapon. This one is focused on giving an additional tactical effect for the player's weapon. It is not focused on lethality, but does have the opportunity for it. I.e, a \emph{Rocket Bayonet} attachment that causes the player to fly when activating the rocket. 

\subsection{Special Weapons}

\emph{Special Weapons} are unique weapons with unique abilities that cannot be modified. These weapons are not hit-scan weapons and fire projectiles that do additional things than damage. They possess the same traits as the regular weapons, but their enhancements cannot be swapped out.
