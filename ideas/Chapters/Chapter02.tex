\section{Weapons}

Weapons in Steel Purge are found around levels and they have a limited amount of ammo. The player will always spawn with the Hamilton P336 pistol which has infinite ammo, but can carry over the weapon from the previous level. If the player runs out of ammo on a specific weapon, they will throw it at an enemy to deal massive damage and switch back to the standard pistol. 

\subsection{Weapons are unique}

Each weapon fires automatically by holding down a button, but \emph{what} they shoot is always different and has a unique effect. 

\subsection{Weapon ordinance}

Weapons, in addition to firing, have a special ability called an \emph{ordinance}. The ordinance allows for both mobility and lethality. Each ordinance will be put on a cool-down before the player can use it again, with the exception of the Hamilton P336.

\subsection{Recoil hovering}

By aiming downwards and shooting mid-air, the player can stay in the air longer by propelling themselves up using the recoil of the weapon.
