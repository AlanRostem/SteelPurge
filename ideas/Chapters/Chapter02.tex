\section{Weapons}

The weapons in Steel Purge will be the primary source of attacking enemies. Weapons have ammo, but they are only limited to how often the player can shoot at a time before reloading. The weapons also have some extra specialities spoken about in this chapter. The player should be able to carry two weapons and switch between them quickly.

\subsection{Enhancements from Weapon Parts}

As parts for weapons exist in the game, each weapon has three part slots compatible for every weapon no matter what it looks like or what it shoots.

\subsubsection{Barrel Mod}

The \emph{Barrel Mod} is an attachable enhancement for the weapon which grants it extra effects when the weapon is firing. I.e, the enhancement makes the weapon shoot burning bullets causing enemies to catch on fire after consecutive hits. 

\subsubsection{Tactical Mod}

This enhancement can be both an extra weapon attached to the weapon or a different tactical enhancement. I.e, a flame-thrower attachment. The input action bound to using this enhancement is separate from the primary firing action. In addition, the enhancement uses a different limited resource. Lastly, the \emph{Barrel Mod}'s effects are also applied to the \emph{Tactical Mod} 

\subsection{Special Weapons}

\emph{Special Weapons} are unique weapons with unique abilities that cannot be modified. These weapons are not hit-scan weapons and fire projectiles that do additional things than damage, along with very high damage. They have non-swappable attachments that have synergy with each other. Also, their ammo is limited to the amount of XE-Slugs the player has in their inventory. The key here is that the clip size of every Special Weapon is small in order to balance for this. 

\subsection{All Weapon Ideas}

This section consists of all the ideas for each weapon, including the special weapons.

\subsubsection{Ballistic Weapons}

\emph{Ballistic Weapons} are the name of the normal hit-scan weapons. These weapons are the ones that can be customized with different mods and abilities, and only fire regular bullets.

Interesting idea: Make every weapon fire faster as the trigger is held, making the player have to "aim" more

\paragraph{KE-6 Swarm}

Kinetic energy orb launcher. Projectiles are explosive and track enemies after a certain distance they travel. 

Special Ability: Salvo Storm - Launch a time bomb energy projectile that scatters multiple projectiles tracking nearby enemies

\subsection{All Mod Ideas}

This section describes attachments and their effects on the weapon it is attached to.

\subsubsection{Barrel Mods}

\paragraph{Wormhole Barrel}

After consecutive shots hit on an enemy or surface, there spawns a black hole that sucks in all enemies and does damage to them. The player can also get sucked in but does not get damaged. 

\subsubsection{Tactical Mods}

\paragraph{Pocket Flamethrower} 

Fire a close-range stream of fire that burns enemies or other destructible objects

\paragraph{Rocket Bayonet}

When activated, the player starts flying in the direction they were looking. Hitting an enemy mid-flight deals immense damage to the enemy and stops the player in their tracks
