\section{Weapons}

The weapons in Steel Purge will be the primary source of attacking enemies. Weapons have ammo, but they are only limited to how often the player can shoot at a time before reloading.

\subsection{Enhancements from Weapon Parts}

As parts for weapons exist in the game, each weapon has three part slots compatible for every weapon no matter what it looks like or what it shoots.

\subsubsection{Barrel Mod}

The \emph{Barrel Mod} is an attachable enhancement for the weapon which grants it extra effects when the weapon is firing. I.e, the enhancement makes the weapon shoot burning bullets causing enemies to catch on fire after consecutive hits. 

\subsubsection{External Mod}

This enhancement is essentially an extra weapon attached to the weapon itself. I.e, a flame-thrower attachment. The input action bound to using this enhancement is separate from the primary firing action. In addition, the enhancement cannot be used very often, as there is a cooldown on it after each usage. Lastly, the \emph{Barrel Mod}'s effects are also applied to the \emph{External Mod}
