\section{Game Goal}

The goal of the game is to complete all the levels. In addition to that, it is possible to find and collect all weapon parts, as well as leveling up your character who learns how to create weapons the more he levels up. 

\subsection{Level Completion}

The player can traverse to the end of a level in order to reach the end and complete it. As part of the game design, the player should defeat enemies in order to gain stronger resources for defeating the bosses at the end of each level.

\subsubsection{Bosses}

Every level features a boss at the end. Bosses are supposed to be unique and can be an individual entity or simply a part of the environment.

\subsection{Progression system}

Steel Purge will have multiple ways to progress other than completing levels. This should give the player a feeling that their character is becoming stronger and more experienced as he travels through his adventure.

\subsubsection{Experience Points and Leveling Up}

The player can level up their character the more enemies they defeat. For every enemy defeated, the player earns points which. At a certain level the player has leveled up, they can earn the ability to craft new weapons.

\subsection{Items}

As part of making the player's character stronger, there are multiple items they can carry to help them on the journey.

\subsubsection{Scrap}

Defeating enemies and destroying other obstacles results in \emph{Scrap} being spawned on the ground. The player can pick up \emph{Scrap} and store them in their backpack \footnote{There should probably be a limit for how much to carry, depending on how the player should be forced to use it more}. 

\subsubsection{XE-Slugs}

The primary resource for activating the weapon mods. It is also the ammunition resource for Special Weapons.

\subsubsection{Weapon Parts}

In many areas of the levels, parts for weapons can be found. They can also be crafted by learning them through leveling up, but this process is less efficient and is more oriented around level design for further levels.
