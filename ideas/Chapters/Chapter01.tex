\section{Game Goal}

The goal of the game is to complete it as fast as possible by moving as fast as possible using the given game mechanics. 

\subsection{Level Time Limit}

A level must be completed within a certain time limit, or else the player dies. The time limits for each level will vary based on the selected game difficulty.

\subsection{Reward system}

The Steel Purge reward system will reward the player with killing enemies and completing the levels as fast as possible. More importantly, the game is about movement and speed, so there will be a speedometer on the player's HUD showing their current speed. Record-breaking speeds will show flashy animations to make the player feel rewarded for moving fast.
