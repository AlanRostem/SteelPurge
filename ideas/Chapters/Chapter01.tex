\section{Game Goal}

The goal of the game is to complete all the levels. In addition to that, it is possible to find and collect all weapon parts, as well as leveling up your character who learns how to create weapons the more he levels up. 

\subsection{Level Completion}

The player can traverse to the end of a level in order to reach the end and complete it. As part of the game design, the player should defeat enemies in order to gain stronger resources for defeating the bosses at the end of each level.

\subsubsection{Bosses}

Every level features a boss at the end. Bosses are supposed to be unique and can be an individual entity or simply a part of the environment.

\subsection{Progression system}

Steel Purge will have multiple ways to progress other than completing levels.

\subsubsection{Weapon purchases}

The player can purchase weapons on buy-stations using \emph{scrap}.

\subsection{Items}

As part of making the player's character stronger, there are multiple items they can carry to help them on the journey.

\subsubsection{Scrap}

Defeating enemies and destroying other obstacles results in \emph{Scrap} being spawned on the ground. The player can pick up \emph{Scrap} and store them in their backpack. Each time the player dies they lose a significant amount of scrap.

\subsubsection{XE-Slugs}

The primary resource for activating the weapon mods.
