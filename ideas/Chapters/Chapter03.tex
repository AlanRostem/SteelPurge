\section{Levels}

The levels in Steel Purge have unique platforming layouts and ways to be completed.

\subsection{Anvils}

The checkpoints on each level is an anvil. These can be used to craft certain items (ammo, weapons, etc.). When a level is complete, before the player is about to leave the level there is an anvil for the player to use. Anvils have a quick repair-and-refill option for players who choose not to upgrade their weapons. There will be a notification on the anvil saying that the player can upgrade or make new weapons and the amount of new things he can explore.

\subsection{Sections/Areas}

Levels are divided into sections and the camera does not move further than the section. When the player moves out of the section the camera pans over to the next section. This mechanic does not apply to Purge Mode.

\subsection{Purge Mode}

Upon clearing a level the player is given the ability to enter Purge Mode on that particular level. This mode is essentially an event that occurs every now and again on cleared levels. The story aspect of this is that the X-Warbs have suddenly appeared in one particular part of the world and you need to destroy them all.

Purge Mode is a round-based mode where you survive as many waves of enemies as possible. Every X rounds a mini-boss appears and defeating it rewards you with a random Stage Y weapon. Dying in this mode has no penalty on the user's progress, but stops the mode and kicks the player out of the level. The player can also choose to exit the level, but this also cancels the mode and the player must wait for another one to appear next time.
